# HapticsVR
 
This project was developed as an exploration of the use of vibrotactile feedback in a virtual reality game. The project consists of a simple scene where the user can break three crates by hitting them with enough force using a hammer. Both auditory and haptic feedback are modulated by the force of each impact.

## Prerequisites

In order to build and run this project, you will need:
* Unity Editor version 2019.2.6f1 64-bit. You may convert the project to work in different versions, but this project was only built and tested using this specific version and therefore is not guaranteed to work with any other versions of the editor.
* Steam and SteamVR. This project uses the SteamVR API for Unity.
* A compatible HMD and controllers. This project has only been tested on the Oculus Rift S with Touch controllers, but should work with any analogous hardware (Oculus Rift CV1, Oculus Quest, HTC Vive). Do note that the haptic feedback has not been tested with any set of controllers other than the Touch Controllers.
